GIT script >>  a Perl script for setting up a Git Hub repo.
This is a *NIX ONLY script.

*********************************************************************************************
You want to use the GIT_script.pl file NOT the Test_Script.pl one.
The Test_Script is used for testing any changes I think will benefit the script.
Although both scripts are similar they are not the same,(usually), things that 
work go into the GIT script things that don't stay in the Test Script and eventually 
get deleted or changed.
*********************************************************************************************

*****************************************************************
You must have a Git Hub account and have you ssh keys already made,
otherwise you will get a fatal error.

INSTALLATION and USAGE:
Unpack archive to a directory then open a terminal and cd to directory where script has been un-archived then in terminal write >> perl name_of_script.pl, in this case GIT_script.pl
Then follow on screen prompts to set up your repo.
Choose option 1 for setting up your repo.
Option 2 to add to an already existing repo.
Option 3 exits script.

This script will help you set up a Git Hub Repo, it will 
initialize an empty repo on your local machine and your 
Git Hub account online. 

It will add a blank README file in your repo if you choose, 
<<<YOU MUST ADD THE README FILE WHEN YOU FIRST SETUP THE REPO ON YOUR PC>>>>>
you can edit the README later then use this script to 'push' it 
to your git hub repo.

Also the script will create a file "commit_record" in your repo
folder on your computer, this is a record of all the commits/pushes you
make to Git Hub along with a timestamp for each record.
It will also add any other file you choose as well, (option 2).
I often use this script my self other than using git-cola or any other
git type program for pushing files to my repo, it's just easier and faster
IMO.

########################################################################
ALWAYS use an underscore or something similar in naming anything	<<<<<<<<<<IMPORTANT
you send to Git Hub when using this script, especially commit messages.
For some reason Git Hub doesn't like spaces between words
and will kick an error if you do and the script will quit.

EXAMPLES: script names >> name_of_script.pl,  
commit message >> added_changes_to_script 

########################################################################

You MUST HAVE a Git Hub account and a named repo to use this script and your ssh keys.
